These files are from an effort to make python bindings for libgeoref by
Kristjan Onu and an intern Maude Preville in 2020.

The task was never completed and the C code has changed in the meantime
therefore these files cannot be used as-is.  However they do contain some
useful code that can be adapted and save some time.
